<< Hand Gesture Volume Control using OpenCV >>

Overview
This project provides a simple implementation of a hand gesture-based volume control system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The program uses your webcam to detect hand gestures and adjust the system volume accordingly.

1. Features - 
Real-time Gesture Detection: The program captures video from your webcam and processes it in real-time.
Volume Control: By recognizing specific hand gestures, the system increases or decreases the volume of your MacBook.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Designed to work primarily on macOS.

2. Requirements -
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
#pip install opencv-python mediapipe


4. How It Works -
Capture Video: The webcam feed is captured using OpenCV.
Hand Detection: MediaPipe is used to detect hand landmarks in the video feed.
Gesture Recognition: The distance between key hand landmarks (e.g., thumb and index finger) is used to determine the gesture.
Volume Adjustment: Based on the detected gesture, the system volume is adjusted using AppleScript commands.
Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
#python project.py
Ensure that your webcam is functional and accessible. The program will start capturing video and recognize hand gestures to control the volume.

Notes
+The system is designed to work on macOS, as it uses AppleScript to change the system volume.
+You may need to grant the necessary permissions to the script to access the webcam and control the system volume.
